            Jebbia has rewritten the rules for streetwear brands in the process, building Supreme's fame through social media hype
            and scarcity. Its clothes can only be bought online or through a network of just 11 stores worldwide: one each in LA,
            Paris and London, two in New York and six in Japan.
            It was in Japan that Supreme perfected a sales tactic known as the "drop" -- releasing a limited quantity of new clothes
            on a weekly basis, rather than an entire new collection every season. The strategy, now widely replicated by traditional
            fashion brands, prompted long lines at Supreme's stores and fueled online resale marketplaces where prices skyrocketed.
            South Korean men lead the world's male beauty market. Will the West ever follow suit?
            "Over time, it really became a huge frenzy," said David Fischer, founder of streetwear and lifestyle website
            Highsnobiety. "It became a huge event, where Supreme fans from around the world would line up in front of Supreme stores
            to get a hold of the latest product ... It's not only about standing in line to buy a new product. It's just as much
            about being there with a community that you're a part of."
            Supreme's most valuable asset is arguably its simple logo, a red rectangle marked with the word "Supreme," which fashion
            platform Lyst crowned the industry's most powerful logo in 2018. It can turn almost anything into a collector's item.
            Supreme's latest collection includes a branded water gun, a coffee maker, a drum kit, a snorkeling mask and even
            Band-Aids. When the New York Post ran a Supreme cover ad in August 2018, newsstands sold out of the paper by early
            morning; Supreme New York MetroCards from 2017 are currently listed on eBay for $500. But there are weaknesses in
            Supreme's all-powerful logo and brand that Supreme Italia has used to its advantage.

            Following a tough and gruelling few weeks of harsh competition, the final team, the Fearsome Four, failed to answer the
            final question correctly. Having put everything on the line, this failure cost them $1,000,000 in potential winnings,
            and was one of the largest upsets seen to date on live television. Millions of fans were in tears and had their hearts
            broken by this defeat, in what is being called 'The Fall of The Four' on social media sites. One can only imagine the
            post-gameshow emptiness and defeat they must be feeling. Following a tough and gruelling few weeks of harsh competition, the final team, the Fearsome Four, failed to answer the

            The team obviously couldn't get the prize and this is just the spamming part of the webpage. As you can see, the webpage
            was so beautifully
            designed by the JCRC. Let's just play the games in Face Off and we all can walk back to our halls. What am I doing here
            is in fact a philosophical
            question that has not reached a definite conclusion yet. The fact that I am asking myself the question is actually the
            answer to the question, although it is
            more likely that I am answering my own question. The question is, however, the answer to itself which contradicts the
            third law of Newton, that is a question can
            not be the answer to itself. This contradiction has paved way to a new generation of phylosophical rebels who think that
            the question can be the answer to itself.
